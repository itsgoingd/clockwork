Clockwork
=========

**[Clockwork](http://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork-chrome) is a Chrome extension for PHP development**, extending Developer Tools with a new panel providing all kinds of information useful for debugging and profiling your PHP applications, including information about request, headers, get and post data, cookies, session data, database queries, routes, visualisation of application runtime and more.

**Not a Chrome user?** Check out [embeddable web app version of Clockwork](http://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork-web), supporting many modern browsers along Chrome with out of the box support for Laravel and Slim.
There are also a third-party [Firebug extension](https://github.com/sidorovich/clockwork-firebug) and a [CLI client app](https://github.com/ptrofimov/clockwork-cli) available.

**This repository contains server-side component of Clockwork** that gathers all the data, stores them in JSON format and serves them for displaying in Chrome Developer Tools extension.

## Installation

This extension provides out of the box support for Laravel, Slim 2 and CodeIgniter 2.1 frameworks, you can add support for any other or custom framework via an extensible API.

To install latest version simply add it to your `composer.json`:

```javascript
"itsgoingd/clockwork": "~1.14"
```

### Laravel

Once Clockwork is installed, you need to register Laravel service provider, in your `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
	...
	Clockwork\Support\Laravel\ClockworkServiceProvider::class,
]
```

For development environment use
```php
'providers' => append_config(['Clockwork\Support\Laravel\ClockworkServiceProvider'])
```

When using Laravel 5, you need to add Clockwork middleware, in your `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected $middleware = [
	\Clockwork\Support\Laravel\ClockworkMiddleware::class,
	...
]
```

By default, Clockwork will only be available in debug mode, you can change this and other settings in the configuration file. Use the following Artisan command to publish the configuration file into your config directory:

```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider='Clockwork\Support\Laravel\ClockworkServiceProvider'
```

For Laravel 4 you can do the same with this command:

```
$ php artisan config:publish itsgoingd/clockwork --path vendor/itsgoingd/clockwork/Clockwork/Support/Laravel/config/
```

Clockwork also comes with a `clock()` helper function, which provides an easy way to add records to the Clockwork log and events to the timeline.

```php
clock()->startEvent('event_name', 'Event description.'); // event called 'Event description.' appears in Clockwork timeline tab

clock('Message text.'); // 'Message text.' appears in Clockwork log tab
logger('Message text.'); // 'Message text.' appears in Clockwork log tab as well as application log file

clock(['hello' => 'world']); // logs json representation of the array
clock(new Object()); // logs string representation of the objects if the object implements __toString magic method, logs json representation of output of toArray method if the object implements it, if neither is the case, logs json representation of the object cast to array

clock()->endEvent('event_name');
```

If you prefer using Facades, add following to your `app/config/app.php`:

```php
'aliases' => [
	...
	'Clockwork' => Clockwork\Support\Laravel\Facade::class,
]
```

### Lumen

Once Clockwork is installed, you need to register the Clockwork service provider, in your `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(Clockwork\Support\Lumen\ClockworkServiceProvider::class);
```

You also need to add the Clockwork middleware, in the same file:

```php
$app->middleware([
	...
	Clockwork\Support\Lumen\ClockworkMiddleware::class,
]);
```

By default, Clockwork will only be available in debug mode (`APP_DEBUG` set to true), you can change this and other settings via environment variables.
Simply specify the setting as environment variable prefixed with `CLOCKWORK_`, eg. `CLOCKWORK_ENABLE`, [full list of available settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsgoingd/clockwork/v1/Clockwork/Support/Laravel/config/clockwork.php).

Clockwork also comes with a `clock()` helper function (see examples above) and a facade thats automatically registered when you enable facades in your `bootstrap/app.php`.

### Slim 2

Once Clockwork is installed, you need to add Slim middleware to your app:

```php
$app = new Slim(...);
$app->add(new Clockwork\Support\Slim\ClockworkMiddleware('/requests/storage/path'));
```

Clockwork is now available in Slim's DI container and can be used like this:

```php
$app = Slim::getInstance();

$app->clockwork->startEvent('event_name', 'Event description.'); // event called 'Event description.' appears in Clockwork timeline tab

$app->clockwork->info('Message text.'); // 'Message text.' appears in Clockwork log tab
$app->log->info('Message text.'); // 'Message text.' appears in Clockwork log tab as well as application log file

$app->clockwork->endEvent('event_name');
```

### CodeIgniter 2.1

Once Clockwork is installed, you need to copy the Clockwork controller from `vendor/itsgoingd/clockwork/Clockwork/Support/CodeIgniter/Clockwork.php` to your controllers directory and set up the following route:

```php
$route['__clockwork/(.*)'] = 'clockwork/$1';
```

Finally, you need to set up the Clockwork hooks by adding following to your `application/config/hooks.php` file:

```php
Clockwork\Support\CodeIgniter\Register::registerHooks($hook);
```

To use Clockwork within your controllers/models/etc. you will need to extend your `CI_Controller` class. (If you haven't done so already) Create a new file at `application/core/MY_Controller.php`.

```php
class MY_Controller extends CI_Controller
{
	public function __construct()
	{
		parent::__construct();
		$GLOBALS['EXT']->_call_hook('pre_controller_constructor');
	 }
}
```

Now you can use the following commands in your CodeIgniter app:

```php
$this->clockwork->startEvent('event_name', 'Event description.'); // event called 'Event description.' appears in Clockwork timeline tab

$this->clockwork->info('Message text.'); // 'Message text.' appears in Clockwork log tab

$this->clockwork->endEvent('event_name');
```

### Other frameworks

There is a [brief architecture overview](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork/wiki/Development-notes) available, that should provide some help when implementing support for new frameworks or custom applications.

If you would like to see or are working on a support for yet unsupported framework feel free to open a new issue on github.
